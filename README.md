This is a repository for writing paper using markdown and sublime text.  The emaphsis is on a couple things:

1. Maximum flexibility (uses pandoc so can output PDF or Microsoft .docx)

2. Simplicity (messing with a lot of boiler place LaTeX is a pain)

3. Quick access to references while writing (plugings for sublime enable inserting references seamlessly while writing).

4. Repeatability (want everyone in the lab to consider this method to simpify writing)

5. Distraction free writing.  Uses themes and the "distraction free" writing mode in Sublime to help you concentrate

6. Uses some special modes for academic writing using markdown.
